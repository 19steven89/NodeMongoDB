can view the mongodb data by opening the Robo3T app in home directory

installed mongo db on the system. in the home directory.

when running the app through the terminal run the command: ./mongod --dbpath ~/mongo-data
in a separate terminal tab so mongodb can run whilst coding the app to use the db.


installed the npm: npm install mongodb@2.2.5 --save
for this app to access the db server and manipulate the DB using the mongodb library

ran the program using: node playground/mongodb-connect.js

which displays the MongoDB content in the output
